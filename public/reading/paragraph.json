	"paragraph": "People living today in the northwestern state of Washington who have many sources of news in addition to newspapers must stretch their imaginations to understand the importance of the press during much of the state's history. Beginning in 1852 with The Cohumblan. the first paper in (5) Washington Territory, newspapers served to connect settlers in frontier communities with each other and with the rnajor events of their times. Unlike many mid-century papers, The Columbian, published every Saturday in Olympia, one of Washington's larger towns, was \"neutral in politics,\" meaning that it was not the organ of a particular political party or (10) religious group. For its first few years, it was the only newspaper in the territory, but during the following decades, enterprising Washingtonians founded many other papers. Few of these papers lasted long. Until the turn of the century, most were the production of an individual editor, who might begin with insufficient capital or fail to attract (15) a steady readership. Often working with no staff at all, these editors wrote copy, set type, delivered papers, oversaw billing, and sold advertising. Their highly personal journals reflected their own tastes, politics, and known as the \"Oregon style\"--graphic, torrid, and potentially libelous. Early newspapers were thick with print, carrying no illustrations or (20) cartoons. Advertising was generally confined to the back pages and simply listed commodities received by local stores. Toward the end of the century, newspapers in Washington began to carry national advertising, especially from patent medicine companies, which bought space from agencies that brokered ads in papers all over the country. By 1900, (25) Washington boasted 19 daily and 176 weekly papers. Especially in the larger cities, they reflected less the personal opinions of the editor than the interests of the large businesses they had become. They subscribed to the Associated Press and United Press news services, and new technology permitted illustrations. Concentrating on features, crime reporting, and (30) sensationalism, they imitated the new mass-circulation papers that William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer were making popular throughout the United States.",
